# Weather-Web-App-Mini-Project-
This website is a simple Weather Web Application mini project which takes data from a pre-built API called Weather by API-Ninjas (https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/) and display it. The user can get weather information from all across the world by searching the place in the search bar.

This Web App is built by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The NavBar is built with the help of Bootstrap and mostly everything else is pure HTML, CSS and JS.

The referance and inspiration for this mini project is taken from a Code With Harry YouTube's Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFvWwFua6mw) but the design of the website is entirely changed. The design of this mini project is inspired by Accuweather's display of information, which built purely with the help of CSS (no Bootstrap properties used).
